After cloning my repository, source the setup.bash file by typing this from the gaitech_ws/ directory:
$ source /devel/setup.bash

Next, open the turtlesim by running the following commands:

$ roscore  //if you don't have one running already
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node 

This should open a turtlesim window to view the turtle in a 2D simulation. Now run the cleaning code by typing:

$ rosrun gaitech robot_cleaner_node

This node publishes a series of messages to a topic which the turtle is subscribed to. This series of messages tells the turtle to go to the bottom right corner of the window, and then cover the window up and down until it reaches the other side. At this point, the turtle returns to its home, the center of the window. You may now close the turtlesim node. 

Next, open the gazebo world with a mobile base in the world. Do this by typing the following command:

$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch  

This should start gazebo with a world with several obstacles inside of it. Delete all of the objects EXCEPT FOR the mobile_base and ground_plane_0. Next, view the bagged files by changing to the bagfiles/ directory and running the following commands:

$ cd bagfiles/
$ rosbag play go_turn_back.bag

This will publish a series of recorded messages to the topic which the turtlebot is subscribed to. The turtlebot will go forward, turn around and come back (as best as I could do with the my keystroke inputs to the turtlebot teleop node). At this point, reset the gazebo environment by running this service:

$ rosservice call /gazebo/reset_world

Now, play the other bag file. This bag file is a recording of a .cpp code which controls the turtlebot. This .cpp uses an open-loop control strategy by modeling the distance and rotation as a function of linear speed input, and angular speed inputs. As Gregory Dudek and Michael Jenkin, in their Computational Principles of Mobile Robotics, say in chapter 2, without some sensory input for localization, the error associated with this open loop control gets worse and worse over time. This is showcased in the simulator which imparts realist physics (inertia, friction, gravity, etc.). This is why the robot fails to follow the grid perfectly (and gets worse over time). To play this bag file use the following command:

$ rosbag play grid_pattern.bag

Alternatively, you can run the node which published these recorded messages by running the following command.

$ rosrun gaitech robot_cleaner_node_v2

Thank you,
Max
